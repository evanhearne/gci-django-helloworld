# gci-django-helloworld
Hello to my mentors viewing this project, and anyone else too! This repository is for a task on Google Code-in 2019 done by evanH2002.
## Description
This site is written in Django, and is a basic site that displays 'Hello-World.' on the page. That's it!
## Setup
Okay, so you've decided you'd like to take a look at my work, how do you do that? Well, first of all there are a few prerequisites, such as:
1) Django, which you can install using this guide [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/install/).
2) Python 3, which you can install using Terminal with this command ```sudo dnf install python38```.
3) Fedora, which you can install using this guide [here](https://getfedora.org/).
**Note: Make sure to install Python 3, as Django will not work properly without it and you may run into problems otherwise.**

Once you have the prerequisites installed, follow the below steps to run the website.
1) Clone this repository in any way you like, as long as it is extracted. You can find a link on how to clone using Terminal [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
2) CD into the repository using the Terminal. You can find a link on terminal commands [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/140679/beginner-geek-how-to-start-using-the-linux-terminal/) if you're unfamiliar with how to use it.
3) Copy ```python3 manage.py runserver``` into the Terminal.
4) Finally you can click [here](http://localhost:8000/googlecodein/) to open the website.

And that's it! Enjoy my website! :D
